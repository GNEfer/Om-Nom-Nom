		<h2>Authentic Japanese Food</h2>
		<h3>Sushi</h3>
		<img src="images/sushi.jpg">
		<p>Sushi is a very popular Japanese food which uses vinegared rice with seafood, vegetables and other variations. Iti is often prepared with raw sliced fish. Without rice, it is called sashimi. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.</p>
		<h3>Ramen</h3>

		<p>Not to be confused with instant noodles seen in packages, Ramen is japanese noodle in soup. It is often served in a fish or meat based broth with soy sauce or miso as flavouring. Common toppings include nori (dried seaweed), eggs, green onions and sliced pork. Like many other dishes, ramen has variations of its own in different parts of Japan.</p>
		<h3>Onigiri</h3>
